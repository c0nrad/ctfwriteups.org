If you solved part 1 before this time, you will need to re-run your exploit to get the current version of the data.\n\nNote 2: The \"reset\" function will also reset the flash memory.\n\nNote 3: For fairness, we've re-hosted the previous version as well at challenge30.play.potluckctf.com If you have found a bug that works there but not on the newer versions, don't waste time on it, it's an unintended red herring. The intended solution works on both version. The change in offsets in the bootloader is not relevant to the exploit.\n",
